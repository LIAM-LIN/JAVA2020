In this workbook, you will build a relational database server from scratch.
This database server will provide the following features:

- To store Entity-Relationship data as a collection of files
- To listen for incoming client requests to interrogate and manipulate the stored data
- To conform to a standard query language that allows operations to be performed on the stored data

It is **essential** that your server is _robust_ - you should detect and trap errors effectively
and ensure that the server continues running at all times. Just imagine a world in which servers
had to be manually restarted every time something unexpected was encountered.
It's going to be very difficult for your server to pass the marking tests if it has crashed !

Note that it is _not_ your responsibility to normalise the database - this is a job for
developers who have designed the database schema and who make use of your database server.

In addition, you will _not_ be required to implement the client-side features of the application.
A database client will be provided for you to help you test your server.

Note that your main class MUST be called `DBServer` and should provide a constructor with
a single parameter (the port number on which to listen). 
Don't change the name of the class or the signatures of any of the methods that already exist
(or we won't be able to test your code !).
We will be using automated marking scripts and if you server does not conform to the above,
we won't be able to run it !
