An issue that we usually don't think about when _using_ a graphical interface is that of layout.
For reasons we will see later, we can't just fix the position of widgets with absolute pixel coordinates.
The slides and video above provide an introduction to positioning of widgets on a screen using containers
called "panes". The nesting of these panes (one inside another) results in very complex code !
This complexity is a common characteristic of GUI code - one which we will return to at the end of this workbook.
