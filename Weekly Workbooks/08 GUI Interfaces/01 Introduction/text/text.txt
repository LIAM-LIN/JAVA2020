Most complex applications have some kind of Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Until this point in the Java unit, we have not considered how such interfaces are created.
This workbook provides an introduction to this topic - again using JavaFX as the implementation framework.
The slides and video above provide an provide an introduction to the building blocks of
JavaFX GUI interfaces (called "Widgets" or "Controls").

Although not assessed, this material may well be useful in your individual projects and in
your future careers. So it is well worth engaging with now - even if it is to just watch
the videos and try out a few examples.
