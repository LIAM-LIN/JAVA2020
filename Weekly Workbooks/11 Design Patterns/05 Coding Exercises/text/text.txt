1) Implement a class, IteratorFun, which takes an array (of any type) as an argument and implements the Java's Iterable interface such that when it is iterated over, using the colon notation, objects are returned in reverse order. A skeleton to get you started is provided <a href="https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/COMSM0086_2020_TB-2/code_snippets/iterator_fun_question.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.

2) Modify the <a href="https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/courses/COMSM0086_2020_TB-2/code_snippets/LiveCodingStrategyQuestion.zip" target="_blank">'bad code'</a>  Sion implemented in the Strategy Pattern â€“ Live coding video such that it uses the strategy pattern as opposed to a switch statement and a flag. Refer to the live coding video above, if you get stuck.
