This week's lectures cover the iterator pattern and strategy pattern. The strategy pattern is particularly useful and should be understood by all OOP developers as it enables selecting an algorithm at runtime - kind of like a function pointer in C. Both patterns are a great vehicle for gaining a deeper understanding of generics, inner classes and abstract inner classes. Understanding these features of Java in depth as well as understanding these patterns will prepare you for other design patterns as well lambdas and streams (not covered in this unit). We suggest you watch all the videos and compile and run the code snippets yourself before attempting the programming exercises.
