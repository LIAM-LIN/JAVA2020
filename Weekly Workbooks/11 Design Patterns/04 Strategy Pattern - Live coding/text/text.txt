You may find that the strategy pattern as described in the PowerPoint slides is a bit tightly bound to comparators and sorting, such that the strategy pattern itself is a bit lost and we think you will benefit from going through another example that's very different and more real world in its motivation. In this live coding example, we will transform some "bad code" that uses flags and switch statements into some "good code" which employs the strategy pattern. We will make frequent references to the strategy pattern's UML diagram so that the theory and implementation equivalences are properly understood.
