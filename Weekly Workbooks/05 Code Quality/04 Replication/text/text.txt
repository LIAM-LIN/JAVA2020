Replication is a big issue for the maintainability of code - view the slides and audio narration above to find out why. With the benefit of the knowledge you have gained from this, consider this <a href="code/NaiveCalculator/NaiveCalculator.java" target="_blank">naive implementation</a> of a command line calculator. It contains a lot of replication and inelegant code - see if you can identify various ways you might be able to factor out the replication. Once you have some ideas, take a look at this <a href="code/RefinedCalculator/RefinedCalculator.java" target="_blank" onclick="alert('You did at least *try* to come up with some improvements - right ? I mean, you didnt just click on this link to see the solution straight way ?\n\nNo, of course not - what WAS I thinking !\n\n\nP.S. You might need to enable pop-ups for this page to view the solution');">more refined solution</a>.
