Take a look at the slides and audio narrative linked to above relating to structural code quality. With the knowledge gained, review the last significant piece of code that you wrote. Issues of cohesion, coupling, dependency and global referencing are relevant to all types of programming (not just object oriented). You might, for example, wish to revisit one of your submissions for one of the previous programming units - to see how your appreciation of structure has changed.
