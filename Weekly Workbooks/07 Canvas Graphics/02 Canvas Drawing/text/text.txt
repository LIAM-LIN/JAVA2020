The concept of a drawing "canvas" is common to many languages and drawing frameworks, including
HTML5, P5.js, JavaFX, D3, SDL, Processing to name but a few. Take a look through the slides and 
video linked to above to gain an understand of canvas operation.
Although our focus in this workbook is primarily on JavaFX,
the high-level concepts are transferable to other frameworks
(although the method names might differ to some extent).
