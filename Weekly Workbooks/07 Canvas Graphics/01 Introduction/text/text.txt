In previous workbooks we have introduced the fundamentals of the Java programming language.
In the following weeks we'll cover some more specialised topics.
The next few workbooks will focus on creating graphical applications using the JavaFX library.
JavaFX has two main parts: "Canvas" & "Controls".
In this current workbook we will start with the drawing Canvas.
In a future workbook we will take a look at Controls (GUI Widgets).

This topic is not an "assessed learning outcome" for this unit.
As such, you will not be assessed on it.
However, this topic might prove to be very valuable if you need a
GUI for your individual project or in your future careers !

JavaFX can be a little fiddly to install, your best bet is to start with

Alternatively you might find it easier to use Maven by following

It's fairly extensive, but is well structured (using the standard "JavaDoc" format).
